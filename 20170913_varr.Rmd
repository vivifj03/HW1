## Case
<div class="columns-2">
  ![](img\w1.png)

  - Woman in her mid-twenties        
  - Frequent bouts of breathlessness            
  - Twin sister $Y$ has the same issue        
  - <div class="red2"> Heart failure </div>          
  - <div class="red2"> Abnormally fast heart rhythm </div>
</div>


## $X$'s family

<br />

<div class="blue2" style="font-size:180%; text-align: center;"><b>What was the cause of abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure in this family?</b> </div>

## Whole exome sequencing

- $X$ and $S$ genome sequencing
- Compare with healthy genome sequence
- Tens of thousands of these variants
- Genes which impact the development and functioning of the heart (200)

    > - The Heartbeat 
    > - The Muscle
    > - The Glue  


## The Heartbeat

- Built-in clock
- at least 25 "channel genes"

<div style="text-align: center;"><IMG HEIGHT="400" WIDTH="350" SRC="img\f3.3.png"></div> 

## The Muscle

## The Glue  

![](img\f3.7.png)  



## Gene candidates

- OBSCN: construction of sarcomeres
- TTN 
- LAMA4: collagen outside the muscle cell 
- DSP


## Missing characters

## How does this variant impact DSP's recipe?   

![](img\f3.9.png)  

## From mice to humans

- Both copies of DSP were knocked-out, mice died while they were still tiny embryos
- DSP knock-out effect happens only in the heart cells, mice survive as embryos but they died within a couple of weeks of birth
- Only one DSP copy is knocked-out, mice were born normally but 20% died within 6 months of birth
- Patients with heart complications and with one copy of DSP prematurely truncated?

    > - The effect of premature truncation in one copy is not fully consistent
    > - Other genes or interactions?
    
## Wrapping Up

- X has heart condition that affects other family members
- Premature truncation of the DSP gene is the likely cause of their affliction
- Arrhythmogenic Left Ventricle Dysplasia
- Another implanted device
- Many genes left
